        <h1>Hi, I'm Natalia</h1>

        <p>
            <img alt="About" src="About.jpg" height="650" class="float-image"/>
            I was born in a small place called <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/tpR79F98xHYnb2qG8/">Tashtyp</a> in the south of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siberia">Siberia</a>.
            I am an aerospace and mechanical engineer based in Auckland, New Zealand. My passion is to solve problems and study new things. At present, I am a student of CS50 class, and
            as a part of homework, I created this website.
        </p>
        <p>
            I got my first degree from <a href="http://en.sibsau.ru//">Siberian State Aerospace University</a>, specialty - spacecraft and upper-stage rocket.
            It is a six years degree, including compulsory work experience, which I passed at <a href="http://www.iss-reshetnev.com/">ISS Reshetnev</a>, a Russian
            satellite manufacturing company. During the last year of study, I decided to continue my education and entered postgraduate program at <a href = "https://www.aut.ac.nz/">AUT University</a>,
            major - mechanical engineering. Hence in 2014, I moved to New Zealand, where I have been since and love the country.
        </p>
        <p>
            Upon graduation, I started to work at <a href="http://phitek.com/">Phitek Systems</a>, a supplier of active noise-cancellation devices and headphones in the aircraft cabin. It was an amazing
            experience for me. I learned a lot about production and testing of connectors, headphones, and charging products for airplanes. A couple of years later, the company faced an internal
            reconstruction, and my role was made redundant. This brought me to my current position as a draftsperson and technical estimator in <a href="http://www.mattaproducts.com/">Matta Products</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            I love to learn and try new things, explore the unknown. In my spare time, you will find me doing all sorts of activities: hiking, camping, paragliding, surfing, dancing, even boxing.
