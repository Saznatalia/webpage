                    I was born in a small place called <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/tpR79F98xHYnb2qG8/">Tashtyp</a> in the south of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siberia">Siberia</a>.
                    My passion is to solve problems and study new things. At present, I am a student at <a href="https://www.massey.ac.nz/">Massey University</a>, study a Graduate Diploma in 
                    Information Sciences. <br/>
                    I got my first degree from <a href="http://en.sibsau.ru//">Siberian State Aerospace University</a>, specialty - spacecraft and upper-stage rocket.
                    It is a six years degree, including compulsory work experience, which I completed at <a href="http://www.iss-reshetnev.com/">ISS Reshetnev</a>, a Russian
                    satellite manufacturing company. In 2014, I moved to New Zealand to continue my education, where I have been since and love the country. <br/>
                    Upon graduation, I started to work at <a href="http://phitek.com/">Phitek Systems</a>, a supplier of active noise-cancellation devices and headphones in the aircraft cabin. 
                    I learned a lot about production and testing of connectors, headphones, and charging products for airplanes. A couple of years later, the company faced an internal
                    reconstruction, and my role was made redundant. After, I started to work as a draftsperson and technical estimator in <a href="http://www.mattaproducts.com/">Matta Products</a>. <br/>
                    During this time, I became curious about Information Technology and took a few online courses, including CS50 - Introduction to Computer Science and CS50's Web Programming with 
                    Python and JavaScript from Harvard University. Finally, I decided that I want to code full-time and entered Massey University to get a degree. <br/>
                    I love to learn and try new things, explore the unknown. In my spare time, you will find me doing all sorts of activities: hiking, camping, paragliding, surfing.
